          A painting depicts early Native American farmers working in a big,
          open field. There are many men and women, and some children working
          together. The women are bent over, digging long rows in the field with
          primitive hoes, tools with long wooden handles with flat, rectangular
          stone blades.

            The fish embryo is long, narrow and straight. Its head is small,
            round, and contains gill arches. A large flap extends to the left,
            from just below the head to the middle of the embryo. A segmented
            bony structure runs the length of the embryo on the right.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reptile embryo is much longer and fatter than the fish embryo,
            but is curled into a fetal position. Its head is bent forward and is
            twice as large as that of the fish embryo. The reptile embryo has
            twice as many gill arches as the fish embryo, but the flap on the
            left side is only half as long. A segmented bony structure runs the
            length of the embryo on the right.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bird embryo is curved more than the fish embryo, but is not as
            long or as curved as the reptile embryo. The head of the bird embryo
            is almost as large as the reptile embryo, but has fewer gill arches.
            A flap the same size as that of the reptile embryo extends to the
            left. A segmented bony structure runs the length of the embryo on
            the right. Arrows point to the gill arches of all three embryos.

            The figure is entitled "FOREIGN TRADE OF COUNTRY X, 1968 through
            1980, in United States dollars". There are two lines on the graph, a
            dashed line labeled "Exports" and a solid line labeled "Imports".<br />
            <br />
            The vertical axis is labeled "Billions of Dollars," beginning with
            zero to eighteen, in increments of 2. A note: one billion equals a
            one followed by 9 zeros.<br />
            <br />
            The horizontal axis is labeled "Year" and lists all the years from
            1968 through 1980.<br />
            <br />
            In the graph, the Exports line begins in 1968 at 3 billion dollars,
            rises steeply to 14 billion in 1974, then drops to 9.5 billion in
            1975 and 1976. In 1977, the Exports line shoots up to 15.5 billion,
            then trails off to 10 billion in 1980.<br />
            <br />
            In the graph, the Imports line begins in 1968 at 2 billion and rises
            steadily to 8.75 billion in 1980, except for minor dips in 1972 and
            1979.<br />
            <br />
            The data are summarized in the following table. Figures are in
            billions of dollars. All data are approximate.

          A map of North America with present day borders shows European claims
          in 1682. Two different, mostly water-routes are marked to show La
          Salle’s route in 1679 and 1682. La Salle’s route in 1679 starts in
          Montreal and goes south, through Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, and then
          loops north, around Michigan, ending in Peoria, Illinois. La Salle’s
          route in 1682 starts in Peoria and goes south, along the Mississippi
          River and the Kentucky and Illinois border. Large swaths of color show
          English, French, and Spanish claims.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The English claims area is almost the entire East coast, including
              several major cities like New York and Philadelphia. The English
              claims area goes from southern Maine to just north of Florida. The
              area extends from the coast in toward the Appalachian Mountains.
              Another English claims area covers much of Southern Canada, with a
              dip into Minnesota and North Dakota.
            </li>
            <li>
              The French claims area is most of the Midwest and some of the
              South, including Kentucky and Louisiana. It goes from north of
              Quebec, to Louisiana in the south, and Idaho in the west.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Spanish claims area is all of Florida and the southern parts
              of Georgia and Alabama. Another Spanish claims area is most of
              Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, with a small portion in Southern
              California, and most of Northern Mexico.
            </li>
            <li>
              The rest of the present-United States, mostly the northwestern
              states, is not claimed.

          <br /><br />The distance from point M to point F is 24 feet.
