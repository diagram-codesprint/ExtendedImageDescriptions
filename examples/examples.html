              A painting depicts early Native American farmers working in a big, open field. There are many men and women, and some children working together. The women are bent over, digging long rows in the field with primitive hoes, tools with long wooden handles with flat, rectangular stone blades.

              <p>The fish embryo is long, narrow and straight. Its head is small, round, and contains gill arches. A large flap extends to the left, from just below the head to the middle of the embryo. A segmented bony structure runs the length of the embryo on the right. </p>
              <p>The reptile embryo is much longer and fatter than the fish embryo, but is curled into a fetal position. Its head is bent forward and is twice as large as that of the fish embryo. The reptile embryo has twice as many gill arches as the fish embryo, but the flap on the left side is only half as long. A segmented bony structure runs the length of the embryo on the right. </p>
              <p>The bird embryo is curved more than the fish embryo, but is not as long or as curved as the reptile embryo. The head of the bird embryo is almost as large as the reptile embryo, but has fewer gill arches. A flap the same size as that of the reptile embryo extends to the left. A segmented bony structure runs the length of the embryo on the right. Arrows point to the gill arches of all three embryos.</p>

              A map of North America with present day borders shows European claims in 1682. Two different, mostly water-routes are marked to show La Salle’s route in 1679 and 1682. La Salle’s route in 1679 starts in Montreal and goes south, through Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, and then loops north, around Michigan, ending in Peoria, Illinois. La Salle’s route in 1682 starts in Peoria and goes south, along the Mississippi River and the Kentucky and Illinois border. Large swaths of color show English, French, and Spanish claims. <ul><li>The English claims area is almost the entire East coast, including several major cities like New York and Philadelphia. The English claims area goes from southern Maine to just north of Florida. The area extends from the coast in toward the Appalachian Mountains. Another English claims area covers much of Southern Canada, with a dip into Minnesota and North Dakota. </li><li>The French claims area is most of the Midwest and some of the South, including Kentucky and Louisiana. It goes from north of Quebec, to Louisiana in the south, and Idaho in the west.</li><li>The Spanish claims area is all of Florida and the southern parts of Georgia and Alabama. Another Spanish claims area is most of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, with a small portion in Southern California, and most of Northern Mexico.</li><li>The rest of the present-United States, mostly the northwestern states, is not claimed.</li><ul></ul></ul>

              A painting depicts early Native American farmers working in a big, open field. There are many men and women, and some children working together. The women are bent over, digging long rows in the field with primitive hoes, tools with long wooden handles with flat, rectangular stone blades.
